97.09.03  V1.1806
          Fixed bug in Mysql.xs: $sth->numfields dumped core because no
	  check for a result was done.
	  Fixed bug in lib/Mysql/Statement.pm: Mysql::Statement.as_string
	  did not check for $sth->numfields != 0.
	  Added patch from Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu)
	  for Term::ReadLine::GNU support to pmysql and dbimon.
	
97.09.03  V1.1805
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: Executing a non-select statement
	  always returned -1 (unknown number of rows) although the
	  correct number was returned by $sth->rows().
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: strlen was executed on a NULL
	  value when mysql_fetch_rows returned a NULL field.
	  Added all _ListField attributes to statement handles.
	  Added support for "LISTFIELDS <table>" to $sth->execute.
	  Modified $sth->func("_ListSelectedFields") and
	  $dbh->func("<table>", "_ListFields") to use the new
	  possibilities; in fact these are only stubs now.
	  Added dbimon.
	  Added some internal attributes for dbimon to DBD::mysql:
	  format_default_size, format_max_size, format_type_name
	  and format_right_justification.

97.08.30  V1.1804
	  Added "fancy", "quote", "separator" and "escape" commands to
	  pm(y)sql.PL.
	  Modified pm(y)sql.PL and pmsql.PL so that it automatically
	  adapts pm(y)sql for use with Msql and Mysql, respectively.
	  Makefile.PL and M(y)sqlPerl/Makefile.PL now automatically
	  adapt lib/M(y)sql.pm, lib/M(y)sql/Statement.pm and
	  lib/DBD/mSQL.pm or lib/DBD/mysql.pm for use in Msql-modules
	  or Mysql-modules; just copy these files, rename them and
	  run "perl Makefile.PL".
	
97.08.29  V1.1803
	  Added mysql_errno()
	  Modified perl modules for use of $driver and isa($driver).
	  Modified Msql.xs and Mysql.xs for use of Package and
	  StPackage.
	  Modified test for fetch of non-result sth in akmisc.t: Msql
	  returns number of rows and not an sth.
