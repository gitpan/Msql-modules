97.09.27 V1.1812
          Added t/50commit.t to test suite.
	  Included <embed.h> in myMsql.h for redefining my_setenv().
	  Made AutoCommit, Commit and Rollback DBI conformant.
	  Fixed reconnect problems with Mysql: mysql_port was 0 on some
	  systems.
	  Added support of mysql_real_connect to myMsql.c.
          Fixed Msql::errno returning a char *.
	  Added lib/Bundle/Msql.pm.

97.09.12 V1.1811
          Fixed 'use Mysql' to 'eval "use Mysql"' in t/mysql2.t.

97.09.12 V1.1810
	  Fixed bug in dbd_st_FETCH_internal: newRV_noinc was used for
	  the return value. This resulted in invalid cache values,
	  reported by Michael Bletzinger
	  <Michael.Bletzinger@ssa.crane.navy.mil>

97.09.12 V1.1809
	  Adapted changes from DBD-Oracle 0.46 to 0.47; in particular
	  the files Driver.xst and dbd_xsh.h from the DBI distribution
	  are used now. (LongReadLen, LongTruncOk, ... are still
	  meaningless, but they are not that important for m(y)sql:
	  The complete results are in RAM anyways ...)
          Fixed man page of DBD::M(y)SQL: "@names = $sth->{'NAME'}".
	  Added parameter completion for "set" command to dbimon.

97.09.08  V1.1808
          Fixed bug in dbimon, a closing brace was missing causing a
          syntax error.
          Fixed problems in the Term::ReadLine::GNU support, reported
          by Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu).
          Modified dbimon for internally using the Data::ShowTable
          module. My thanks to Tim Bunce for the hint.
          Compatibility fixes for SunOS and Solaris, supplied by
          Neil Bowers (neilb@cre.canon.co.uk).

97.09.03  V1.1807
	  Fixed missing environ declaration in myMsql.c by including
	  EXTERN.h and perl.h.
	  Forgot to add dbimon.PL to MANIFEST --> make failed.

97.09.03  V1.1806
          Fixed bug in Mysql.xs: $sth->numfields dumped core because no
	  check for a result was done.
	  Fixed bug in lib/Mysql/Statement.pm: Mysql::Statement.as_string
	  did not check for $sth->numfields != 0.
	  Added patch from Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu)
	  for Term::ReadLine::GNU support to pmysql and dbimon.
	
97.09.03  V1.1805
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: Executing a non-select statement
	  always returned -1 (unknown number of rows) although the
	  correct number was returned by $sth->rows().
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: strlen was executed on a NULL
	  value when mysql_fetch_rows returned a NULL field.
	  Added all _ListField attributes to statement handles.
	  Added support for "LISTFIELDS <table>" to $sth->execute.
	  Modified $sth->func("_ListSelectedFields") and
	  $dbh->func("<table>", "_ListFields") to use the new
	  possibilities; in fact these are only stubs now.
	  Added dbimon.
	  Added some internal attributes for dbimon to DBD::mysql:
	  format_default_size, format_max_size, format_type_name
	  and format_right_justification.

97.08.30  V1.1804
	  Added "fancy", "quote", "separator" and "escape" commands to
	  pm(y)sql.PL.
	  Modified pm(y)sql.PL and pmsql.PL so that it automatically
	  adapts pm(y)sql for use with Msql and Mysql, respectively.
	  Makefile.PL and M(y)sqlPerl/Makefile.PL now automatically
	  adapt lib/M(y)sql.pm, lib/M(y)sql/Statement.pm and
	  lib/DBD/mSQL.pm or lib/DBD/mysql.pm for use in Msql-modules
	  or Mysql-modules; just copy these files, rename them and
	  run "perl Makefile.PL".
	
97.08.29  V1.1803
	  Added mysql_errno()
	  Modified perl modules for use of $driver and isa($driver).
	  Modified Msql.xs and Mysql.xs for use of Package and
	  StPackage.
	  Modified test for fetch of non-result sth in akmisc.t: Msql
	  returns number of rows and not an sth.
